# Instructions

Hey professor! This is my final project submission. This project builds and runs successfully in Android Studio (Kotlin, minimum SDK 28, using Kotlin DSL and ViewModel architecture).

Everything is already configured:
- Just open the project folder in Android Studio
- Make sure to sync Gradle and enable internet for the emulator to load the quote of the day
- Run the app on a device or emulator to start logging moods
Thank you for your time.
